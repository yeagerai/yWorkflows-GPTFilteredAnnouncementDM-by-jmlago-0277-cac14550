# GPTFilteredAnnouncementDM

This workflow will monitor all announcement channels, filter new messages based on a custom GPT prompt for relevancy, and send a Direct Message (DM) to the user with the selected messages. It will use Discord API to interact with the channels and DMs, and the OpenAI API to filter messages using GPT.

## Initial generation prompt
a workflow that looks at all announcement channels that I have, filters new messages for ones interesting to me (just a custom prompt for GPT) and sends me a DM.
